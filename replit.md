# Saudi Marketing Agency Website

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for Saudi Marketing, a creative agency that brings Saudi excellence to the Egyptian market. The application features a modern, professional website with a contact form system and admin functionality for managing submissions.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with separate client and server directories:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theming

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming

### Backend Architecture
- **Express Server**: RESTful API with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation for development
- **API Routes**: Contact form submission and retrieval endpoints

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user management (id, username, password)
- **Contact Submissions Table**: Store contact form data (name, email, company, service, message, timestamp)

### UI Design System
- **Typography**: Inter for body text, Playfair Display for headings
- **Color Scheme**: Black and white theme with neutral grays
- **Components**: Full shadcn/ui component suite for consistency

## Data Flow

1. **Contact Form Submission**:

   - API call to `/api/contact` endpoint
   - Data validated and stored in database
   - Success/error feedback to user

2. **Admin Dashboard** (Future):
